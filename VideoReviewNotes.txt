CheckLic 0
- Clear and easy to understand goals to work from
- Excellent use of visuals to help aid in explanation
- For the testing strategy, is there another way to tell if you are done rather then "you are convinced there are no more bugs"?

CheckLic 1
- Level 1 DFD doesn't have data flowing between between entities
- Not very many Non-Functional requriments, is there anymore you could add?
- Feature testing is thoughtfully laid out and organized, the extended descriptions of features is also very helpful

CheckLic 2
- Design is fairly minimal, could have had more diagrams or figures to help in explanation
- In the Feasability section, could you elaborate more on the original scope the client had in mind?
- Audio is clear, well spoken and easy to follow from all group members

Cyclops 0
- Some explanations are long and unessecary, consider shortening this for clarity
- DFD is well thought out, labled proficiently, and overall executed perfectly
- Were there any other tech stack options you had considered besides Unity, Flutter, and Ionic?

Cyclops 1
- Visuals and presentation style was very appreciated, kept me engadged 
- For your two implementation goals, eco tracker and text editor, how were planning on implementing them? How much should you have done by each milestone?
- Having your non-funcitonal requirements orginazed into three groups was a smart decision 

Cyclops 2
- Could your end-user sub groups be considered sperate from each other? They both seem fairly disinct
- Having different automated testing for certain features was a good idea
- DFD should have the data flows labeled, don't think it's enough to just explain it auditorily 

Ethics Dashboard 0
- On some of the slides, having only visuals with the audio isn't enough. There should be at least a few bullet points on each slide that follows the audio
- Powerpoint design show be the same throughout the presentation
- Where in canada would the system location be located? Wouldn't it be only in ubc and ubco?

Ethics Dashboard 1
- Overview of the software was clear and understandable, all features clearly stated
- Your non-funcitonal requirments are a bit unclear, unsure what they are
- For the techstack, was having free reign on what you chose more challenging or liberating?

Ethics Dashboard 2
- Design too minimal, some bullet points, very few visuals
- For the user groups, how many features are shared between the TAs and Intructors? Could some of the features be changed to be shared?
- The Tentative Testing Plan was a useful addition, it should help streamline testing

Woo Woo Network 0
- Having dates for your features is a good idea to keep on track
- How is an appropriate healer determined for a client?
- Milestones in the DFD clearly labled and explained given the size of the diagram

Woo Woo Network 1
- Slides have too detailed descriptions, should be in bullet point form
- Is there any flexablity in the tech stack, or has the client only allowed these specific programs?
- Functional requirments should be clearly labeled, and summerized

Woo Woo Network 2
- Is the developer user group nessecary to include? How does it change if you were to only have healers and clients?
- The features for each milestone should be further broken down in the slides for a clearer understanding
- User preferences being an enviromental constraint I feel is half true, you can only appease them so much

LIMS 0
- Highly detailed description and clear understanding of goals
- DFD level 1 slightly difficult to read, and data flow not very well explained
- What makes your must have components "must have"?

LIMS 1
- Video is short but consise, both a good and bad thing
- Could elaborate more on the core functionalities in each milestone?
- No level 1 DFD available?

LIMS 2
- Target user goals described in great detail, each could be easily transcribed into a feature
- In the languages choice section you mention Go and Fyne. Are these the same thing? Do they work tangentially with each other? Fyne was not Described.
- Non-functional requirments are vast, and also described well. It's clear you have put a lot of thought into them

AGM 1
- Grouping the user groups by company size is an intresting approach
- Each functional requirment is given a full description, and it's use for the product is well stated
- How important is the super admin in the data flow diagram? Is it nessecary?

AGM 2
- Full decription on what each user group should be able to do is useful way to track progress
- Both DFDs have a clear data flow structure, and all data has a purpose
- Is it correct to have the Admins and Moderators grouped together in the DFD? They seem to have different funcitons

MIM 0 
- Weighting pros and cons for each tech stack is an intresting to make your choice on which to use. I apprciate that it was included
- Is there anyway for the user to better use the product other than running a python script? Could you develop a GUI of some sort?
- Workflow outline seems pretty standard, not sure if it should have been included in the video

MIM 1
- DFD seems fairly small and should have more features
- Timeline for features we thought out and organized by date, the graph is also a good visualization of the timeline
- Since you couldn't find any open resources for facial recognition, will you be still be utilizing this approach? Or will you try to do something less time consuming?

TMI 0
- Overall, slides have very little on them, should have diagram or figures to fill space, if the information is sufficient
- Should be more non-functional requirments listed, such as compatability and efficiency
- Was python and C++ the only available language offered by the client? Was there another language you could have suggested?

TMI 1
- All users should talk for an equal amount of time, the first person talked for more then half the video
- Diagram were very detailed and elaborate, but they should have been cut down somewhat for clarity
- Do you have specific dates in mind for the completion of each feature?

TMI 2
- Fully indepth and detailed description for the project, excellent research
- Arrows should be labeled in the DFDs with specific data being transfered, also no level 0 DFD
- What made you choose Google Test as your unit testing measurer?
