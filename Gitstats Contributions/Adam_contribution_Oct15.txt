Presentation is very visually appealing
was confused about what was being explain at times
Seemed like the last team member didn’t present as much of the content
Milestones could possible broken down into smaller chunks i.e. a more low level view
Functional and non functional requirements aren’t clear

Checklick (1)
Lots of text on the slides makes them difficult to read
Slides are descriptive 
Diagrams are somewhat difficult to comprehend, however seem to be descriptive
Categorized functional requirements are good, as well as some nice quantifiable non functional requirements
language makeup chart is nice

Checklick (2)
High level overview is quite in depth and eloquently explained
Nice to see major deliverables in high level overview
slides seem somewhat crowded at times
Interesting to point out that there is a lack of functional requirements for this project
requirements more properly classified?
Additional testing for visual aspects is a good addition
Use of the term components is confusing with regards to React and Bulma

Cyclops (0)
Detailed user groups 
Video is a little long
Detailed environmental constraints
Simple level 0 dfd is easy to read and understand 
Pros and cons of each part of the text stack is a nice addition
Detailed explanation of tech stack
Testing process is well explained using proper terminology and is well researched

Cyclops (1)
The background music is a nice addition
Nice graphics 
Explanation behind plan is well thought out and consistent with other groups
Explanation of how different user groups will use the application is clear and concise 
Hosted web app maybe not ideal label for the component of the application serving the application 

Cyclops (2)
Outline of the video is a nice addition
Information on slides should maybe be reduced into bullet points for readability
Dfds possibly lacking information or some information should be changed (items should be labels on arrows etc)
Testing strategies are well explained

Ethics Dashboard (0)
Summary text on slides might be a good addition
Explanations are eloquent and detailed 
Terminology for some of the technologies is incorrect and there are some editing errors
Level 1 dfd is well labeled, explained and easy to read 
Milestones are well organized and categorized
The explanation of the backend and database was very thorough and specific techniques and strategies were outline, which was beneficial to understanding

Ethics Dashboard (1)
Paragraphs on the slides can make information more difficult to absorb
Both level 0 and 1 DFD are detailed and easy to read
Save work might not be necessary for level 1 dfd
Many detailed milestones, although the timeframes may not be clear
Voiceover is mostly read off of slides at times
Taking into account future developers working on the product is a good addition when choosing tech stack

Ethics Dashboard (2)
Slides are easy to read and points are well organized
Goals for each user group are detailed and well explained
Chosen tech stack is well thought out
Level 0 dfd is very detailed, maybe lightly too much so, difficult to comprehend
Level 1 dfd very detailed and explanation of functionality of each class is a good addition 
Colour coded text on database eases readability 
Non functional requirements: scalability -> responsiveness 
Good outline of testing tools 

Woo Woo Network (0)
Timeline for requirements is detailed
Detailed user group descriptions
Level 0 DFD is very easily readable and well explained
Features in level 1 DFD are obvious 
Maybe testing protocols could be explained in more detail, ie. what types of testing methodologies will be used etc

Woo Woo Network (1)
Text density on intro slides quite high, makes reading difficult
User group slide is well organized and readable 
Level 1 DFD might be lacking more technical details
Tech stack is well thought out and diagrams/visuals are a nice addition 
Requirements are detailed but bullet points might be good to increase readability on slides

Woo Woo Network (2)
What is each user group looking to be able to do when using the application?
Detailed explanation of purpose of DFD 
What is the timeline for each milestone?
More details for each milestone might be beneficial
Textual outline of functional requirements on slides would make them easier to understand 
Quantifiable performance metrics (2 seconds to log in)
Potential costs considerations is a nice addition 
Testing being broken down by component helps with readability 

LIMS (0)
Definition of LIMS is appreciated
Motivation for building new LIMS is well explained
High level overview is broken down in to easily digestible chunks
Will you have people peer reviewing your prs after individual integration testing?

LIMS (1)
Video might be slightly short
What is QC procedure tracking? Quality control?
Slides are concise yet informative
Which requirements are to be completed at which milestones
Tech stack well explained

LIMS (2)
User group breakdown is detailed
Nice diagram for operational process
Details milestone  breakdowns
Will you be able to ensure aws servers are located within Canada to comply with laws surrounding medical information?
Testing strategy could probably be more detailed
How will Jira be used in regression testing

AGMeeting (1)
Detailed product description gives good understanding of project
Target use groups are specific 
Mentions “light” version of the application, maybe explain that in more  detail
Dfd could use more labeling between nodes
Blank screen for tech stack and testing strategy

AGMeeting (2)
Nice to have a succinct main project goal in the overview
Detailed description of DFDs
Skipped explanation of some of the functional requirements
Good detailed overviews of different aspects of the system in functional requirements
What is considered a reasonable amount of time for performing tasks
NodeJS would probably be considered backend

MIM (0)
No description of how preprocessing of data is done
Detailed DFDs which are easy to comprehend
I appreciate the functional requirements being divided into user requirements and features
Good in depth discussion of how prs will be handled 
Breakdown of testing methods makes them easier to understand

MIM (1)
Text someone crowded on description slide
Simplicity of DFDs is nice, however they still manage to be descriptive
Data flow diagram components slides = functional requirements slides?
Table outlining tasks and completion dates is great
Curious about parallelization in pytorch and tensorflow because there was conflicting information about ease of parallelization
Model types seem well researched 

TMI(0)
Could potentially use more description about what exactly the data pipeline is and how it works
Level 1 DFD could use more information
